Welcome to my rough version of a README. This is my first one so go easy on me.

ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-This is the first React App I've ever created, woot!
-I watched a ton of React Tutorials by Scott Tolinski to get 'er done.
-I paid for a $7 Food2Fork API (250 calls per day) to pull all of my data from, but then I decided to just make
 my own API to get all of these recipe data from
