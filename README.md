Welcome to my rough version of a README. This is my first one so go easy on me.

ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first React App I've ever created, woot! I used TypeScript the actual app and Vanilla JS to make the Recipe API. I watched a ton of React Tutorials by Scott Tolinski to get 'er done. Initially I paid for a $7 Food2Fork API (250 calls per day) to pull all of my data from, but then I decided to just make my own API to get all of the recipe data from and I added some more information to the data to allow for different ways to sort recipes. 

HOW TO SET IT UP
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resources I used:

Dependencies:
//Gotta go through my package.json to figure out what needs to be installed

Example API that I followed to help me set up the Recipe API:
