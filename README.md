This is the first React App I've ever created, woot! I watched a ton of React Tutorials by Scott Tolinski to get 'er done.
Initially I paid for a $7 Food2Fork API (250 calls per day) to pull all of my data from, but then I decided to just make my own API to get all of these recipe data from and I added some more information to the data to allow for different ways to sort recipes.
